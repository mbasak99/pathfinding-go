# Pathfinding Algorithms in Go
I created this project to learn more about how pathfinding algorithms work, as well as to become better at coding things out in Go. This project was inspired by Cl√©ment Mihailescu's [Pathfinding-Visualizer](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Pathfinding-Visualizer) repo.

## Why are Pathfinding Algorithms important?
Ever wonder how Google Map's chooses the best route? Or how NPCs in the games you play get around without being stuck on the tiniest pebble on the ground? Pathfinding algorithms are crucial to these applications (and many more) and it's why there are so many different types of pathfinding algorithms. Each algorithm has its own trade-off and it's up to the developer to pick the best one based on their scenario.

## How to run the program
While inside the project directory:
`go run ./cmd/main.go`

To see the flags available run the above code with the `-h` flag. Like so:
`go run ./cmd/main.go -h`
